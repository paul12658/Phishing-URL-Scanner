#  Phishing URL Scanner

A simple but powerful web tool that helps detect suspicious or malicious URLs using both quick heuristics and Google Safe Browsing threat intelligence.

---

## Features

- Detects suspicious patterns in URLs:
  - IP addresses instead of domain names
  - Suspicious or rare domain endings (e.g., `.zip`, `.xyz`, `.tk`)
  - Weird characters often used in scam URLs
  - Unusually long URLs

- Integrates with **Google Safe Browsing API** to flag:
  - Malware
  - Phishing
  - Unwanted software links

- Built with Python and Flask â€“ no JavaScript required
